In this folder you will find very poor quality inference that a model produced. Notice how if you look closely around the peremiter of the images there is an odd shadow or highlight.

It is imparative to keep in mind that these types of archietectures do not see the world in the same way you and I do. The model sees way more detail than we might be able to even perceive. 
For that reason you should proceed with caution when adding new images into the dataset from inference, and make sure you name the new images something you can recall and is unique.

Please refer to the before pictures as well as some of them have this same defect in order for me to highlight the issue.
See inverted images for clearest representation of what issues you sould be looking for before adding any images to the training data.

If you were to add inferenced images to your data set you take on the risk of all potential defects that exist in them and could introduce new, and potentially unwanted, generalizations into your Model's parameters.
